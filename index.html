                My name is Aarush Aitha, and my goal is to become a cyber defense expert.  I would like to work at Google, doing a job to protect the privacy of users at all times. I am currently a tenth grader at Dublin High School, taking Principles of Engineering, AP Statistics, and AP Chemistry. I am also competing in a cybersecurity competition (AFA CyberPatriot) and am currently the captain of a 6 member team. Additionally, I am a programmer for a VEX Robotics Team (5327X), and we qualified to the world competition. In order to achieve my goal of becoming a cyber defense expert, I will continue to excel at these things, as well as take the CyberSecurity and Cisco Networking classes, and continue to participate in the AFA CyberPatriot competition.  I also plan on attending MIT or Carnegie Mellon college, and majoring in computer science/cyber security, in order to continue pursuing my goal. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p id="explanation">
                As I mentioned previously, my goal is to become a cyber defense expert with a strong computer science background. I've always known that I would become a programmer/software engineer, but my dream to become a cyber defense expert was ignited when I was 10 years old. My brother was hacked by a phishing attack and lost all the data on his laptop. This incident inspired me to be more careful with my actions on computers, and it also inspired me to become a defense expert so that no one close to me would ever have to have such a frightening experience again. Throughout middle school, I studied various programming languages to prepare me for writing scripts and programs to protect the important data of my friends and family. At the beginning of high school, I became eligible for the AFA CyberPatriot competition. I had already been attending the high school club's meets during middle school, so as a freshman I was ready to captain my own team of 6 members. I have learned a lot of useful practices from CyberPatriots that I use in my everyday life, such as always keeping the Firewall on, never clicking suspicious links in emails, auditing programs and tasks, penetration testing against a servers and websites, and many other vital security practices. I have a lot of passion for this area of interest because I've always been interested to know how to prevent myself from being hacked by other people, and if I learn these skills, then I can also make a change in the world by protecting the data of everyone in the world.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p id="strengths">
                As a dedicated, diligent, and hardworking high school student, I often find that focusing in school and achieving the grades that I desire is simple, meaning that I'm confident in my abilities to succeed in college and beyond. I have been told before that I have a lot of perseverance, especially when I am told that I can't do something. This led me to learn subjects that were years above my grade level during middle school and high school. This was shown especially in 8th grade, when I started taking math at the high school because there were no more math courses that the middle school could provide for me. I was revered by classmates that were older than me, and I excelled in a class that was extremely above my grade level. I am also resourceful, because I am mostly a self-taught programmer and learned most of what I know now from online courses and reading articles on languages that I was interested in learning. Programming has always been like solving a math problem for me, and I live for the satisfaction that I receive when I fully debug a program that I had been working on for the past couple of months.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p id="accomplishments">
                As I entered high school, my interest for computer science and software engineering was at its peak, and I was introduced and invited to the Cyber Security club. I formed a team, and my team and I placed in the top 10 percent of the nation. Over the summer between ninth and tenth grade, I completed a college level computer science course which was at an accelerated pace, Introduction to Structured C++. It was an extremely rigorous class, but I was able to persevere through all the challenges it presented and I achieved the grade that I desired. Currently, I am on a competitive robotics team (5327X) and I am the programmer for my team. The season hasn't ended yet, but we have already qualified for the state rounds and are currently working on an autonomous program for the Skills Challenge. In middle school, I won the school spelling bee in mid January of 2017 (as an 8th grader), and after winning the Junior High Dublin School District competition, I moved on to the Alameda County Junior High Spelling bee in March of 2017, in which I placed first. I finally placed seventh in the California Junior High state spelling bee later on in May 2017, which was one of my greatest achievements of junior high.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p id="conclusion_par">
                While I am only a sophomore in high school, I have learned that I am a hardworking, persevering, resourceful, and diligent student who always takes the initiative whenever I can. I have a strong passion for cyber security and cyber defense, and I desire to be an expert in this field with a fully developed computer science and software engineering background. I have exeperience in programming with Java, C++, Python, HTML, and CSS. I am also skilled with using the terminal in Linux systems, since the CyberPatriot competitions require an in depth knowledge of this operating system. Through my past experiences, I have learned that knowledge is the one way to succeed in life, and I would do anything to gain more of it.

                  <p>Scratch, a website created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a simple coding environment wih drag and drop elements that are easy to work with for people who are new to computer programming. The Scratch Project was the first partner-oriented task that we were given in CSE (Computer Science/Software Engineering). We were told to make a fully functioning game, given some basic <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit" target="_blank">criteria</a>. We also made a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> account, created a project, and shared it between me and Zachary so that we both had access to it. Our game was called "A Battle Against Grey". One important requirement for the Scratch Project, and most other projects, was to create an Engineering Notebook. This notebook included daily documentation of our progress throughout the given timeframe. It also contains our original ideas, a flowchart created with <a href="https://www.draw.io/" target="_blank">draw.io</a>, instructions to our game, and comments. The notebook that we edited and worked on is linked <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ZTqT0R77vchfeOw84Px1VmSYcGYXB_XuEyWWjiKLjE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. For this project, we had multiple drafts for our game. The first draft is linked <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/172692606/" target="_blank">here</a>, while the second and final draft is linked <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173775774/" target="_blank">here</a>. Please feel free to comment, like, remix, and play our game in Scratch!</p>

                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/overlaysun_1.png" alt="">
                  <p>In this project, we were asked to manipulate an image based on a chosen client's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g919kguNczub1LxhojTfSCugJ-o8HiE33m9lY2A0l80/edit" target = "_blank">requirements</a>. We used the <a href="http://effbot.org/imagingbook/pil-index.htm" target = "_blank">PIL Imaging Library</a> to add multiple manipulations. Our code worked on an entire folder of images that was provided by the user, showing that our manipulations were not unique to specific types of images. We chose McDonald's as our client, so two out of our three manipulations were centered around them. Our first manipulation blended the McDonalds logo and the current image from the folder, and the user was able to have interaction with the code by specifying a ratio between the opacity of the logo and the given image. Our second manipulation shrunk the McDonalds logo to 25x25, and then it pasted the mini image over and over around the given image to create a border made out of mini-logos. Our last manipulation was not really related to McDonalds, so it just inverted all the colors of the image. Throughout this project, we were asked to keep a documentation of all our work, which is linked <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mqOa3IfVJniTR17SLgbvmttbEsbNjXJzc1CgfAWUhg4/edit?usp=sharing" target = "_blank">here</a>. We coded our manipulations in an online cloud IDE called Cloud 9, and the link to our workspace can be found <a href="https://ide.c9.io/aarush3002/cse4-aitha-a" target = "_blank">here</a>. Please feel free to use our manipulations in any way you want! You can change the logo that we used as well.</p>

                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/car.png" alt="">
                  <p>In this project, we were told to build a car that was powered by alternative energy sources (solar panels and hydrogen cells). This project required us to use the skills that we had just recently learned about power, voltage, current, and resistance to make an optimal power configuration using alternative power resources. My personal responsibilities in this project were to build the chassis of the car and help with wiring the motor and the power sources on a breadboard. I learned a lot from this project, especially about how hydrogen cells work (splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, then recombining it to produce energy). Some skills I utilized in this project were communication skills, math skills (using Ohm's Law and P=IV), and technology skills (creating a simulation of the car in NetLogo). We found that the solar cell was much more efficient and useful than the hydrogen cells. First, we had to build a car that could be functional so that we could travel quickly over the span of a one meter distance. We conducted multiple tests to find the optimal configuration, which turned out to be one hydrogen cell and one solar cell wired in parallel. We had to modify our design a couple times because we found that we didn't have enough torque to overcome the frictional force of the table and the resistance force coming from the weight of the car itself. So, we decided to change our gear ratio from 7:1 (which provided too much speed and not enough torque) to 5:3, which provided a good balance of speed and torque.

                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">Rocket Design</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Designing an aerodynamically strong paper rocket</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/IMG-1025.JPG" alt="">
                  <p>In this project, I was asked to construct an aerodynamically sound rocket using only paper and certain types of tape (which included packing tape, duct tape, scotch tape, etc.). This project required me to use skills that I had learned about aerodynamic capabilities of planes, and the various forces that act upon a body in the air, such as drag, thrust, lift, and gravity. My personal responsibilities in this project were to build the rocket and record data during the test launches. Some skills I utilized in this project were math skills, physics skills, free body diagrams, force vector diagrams, and various equations to calculate the distance and/or velocity of the rocket at a single point. The constraints and further information for this project can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qkUAQEUPy9462oes7L8aWdvFH96zBWYwSZvf-qZUBE8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. For this project, I had 2 opportunities to launch two separate rockets that I designed. For my first launch, I constructed a rocket out of thin construction paper and duct tape. I used 3 triangular fins that were roughly 1/4 of the height of the body of the rocket, and I placed them at the bottom of the rocket. My first rocket traveled 84 yards in 4.76 seconds. I launched both of my rockets at 45 degrees and 60 psi. After a couple days of designing my second rocket, I launched it but unfortunately it only traveled 18 yards in 1.96 seconds. This was due to the fact that I used packing tape instead of duct tape to secure the pressure cap and nose to the body, so they both detached from the body of the rocket during the launch sequence. This caused the air resistance to overcome the thrust, which provided an opportunity for gravity to pull the rocket down to the ground.

                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">An interactive seating chart our AP CSA class made together for our teacher.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/seating-chart.PNG" alt="">
                  <p>At the beginning of the year, our class realized that many teachers have a hard time remembering all the names of every single student in all of their classes. Therefore, our teacher gave us the idea to make an interactive seating chart with <a href="https://www.greenfoot.org/door" target="_blank">Greenfoot</a>, a graphical code editor. He wanted to learn more about us by clicking on our picture, which would then trigger a unique animation and prompt him, the user, to ask some questions about our skills and interests. 

As a class, we worked together using GitHub to create this project. I was a buildmaster for this project, and this meant that I helped to manage everyone else’s commits and all the feature branches that we were using. This also meant that I had to fix merge conflicts, which was time consuming but taught me a lot about the Git Workflow.

For my animation, I transformed every other avatar in the seating chart into my own picture, and had the entire class (which were clones of me) chant my first and last name a few times. I also had a question system that had two levels to it, so that if my teacher asked a question it would respond in a way that prompted another question on the same subject. After closing my animation, it would return the world back to its original state. The GitHub repository for this project is linked <a href="https://github.com/DHS-CP/p3seatingchart" target="_blank">here</a>.

                  <p>For this project, we were told to develop a simple app using <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank">Android Studio</a>, a java based mobile development environment. The requirements were to make a simple app with four different screens, including one login/title screen. Then our teacher told us that this project was modeled off the Congressional App Challenge, and we were asked to create a video to describe our app, Boon.

The premise of the app is to provide a database in which high school students (and any volunteer for that matter) can store the hours that they have earned while doing community service. It also has tabs with which you can search for volunteering organizations nearby. You can log volunteer hours in another tab, and the last tab will show you individual events that one volunteering organization is offering. 

We submitted a video to the Congressional App Challenge for 2019, which is linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgxetnbSBeE" target="_blank">here</a>, and we are currently awaiting the results which should be coming out mid to late December of 2019.
